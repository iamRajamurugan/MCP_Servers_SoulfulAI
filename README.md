# MCP Servers by SoulfulAI 🚀

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** — built for **adya.ai Hackathon**  

---

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to **MCP_Servers built by SoulfulAI**, a MCP-server project demonstrating end-to-end, context-aware integrations with real-world services. 
Built for adya.ai Hackathon, this repository showcases modular, extendable MCP servers designed to plug into LLM-powered clients and support seamless two-way context access.
Tested with relavent clients and the **Postman API testing** as well.

### Why It Stands Out
- **Universal connectivity**: MCP acts like “USB‑C for AI” 
- **Eliminates N×M point-to-point integration issues** 
- **Well-rounded**: Completed servers + tests, clean architecture, demo video, and full submission.

## ✅ Completed MCP Servers

| MCP Server              | Status    | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Context7 MCP Server    | ✅ Completed | Handles dynamic context switching and custom prompts.                      |
| Firebase MCP Server    | ✅ Completed | Manages realtime DB reads/writes and push triggers.                       |
| OBS MCP Server         | ✅ Completed | Connects with OBS Studio for live event control and scene switching.        |
| Salesforce MCP Server  | ✅ Completed | Integrates with Salesforce API for lead & CRM operations.                  |
| Supabase MCP Server    | ✅ Completed | Supports Supabase Realtime DB queries & auth operations.                   |

_All test suites for each server are passed (100% coverage in critical paths)._

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

- ✅ **Unit Tests** for core handlers in each service
- ✅ **Integration Tests** with local or mock instances (e.g. Firebase emulator, Supabase CLI)
- ✅ **Behavioral Tests** using test prompts against MCP clients confirming end-to-end flow
